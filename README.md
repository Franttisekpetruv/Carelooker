This is the repo for my first large full-stack project. Using JavaScript - MongoDB - Express - EJS - Node.js
Currently the project is 60% finished with basic back-end and front end. 
I am plannig on creating a larger database, authentication and more interesting back-end calculations for the user
Maybe even implementing some ML and AI :D

The project is built from a database of all hospitals in michigan and allows the user to see and edit, upload and delete them as well as add reviews.
